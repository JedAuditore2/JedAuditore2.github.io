## Current
I am seeking a PhD position in Mechanical Engineering.

## Short Bio
I am Jiacheng Xue (薛嘉诚), a [Bachelor’s/Master’s] student in Mechanical Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University. My research focuses on mechanical metamaterials, machine learning-based inverse design, and composite materials.

## Research Experience

### Online Monitoring and Closed-Loop Control of 3D Printing
*Sept. 2022 – Sept. 2023*
- Achieved recognition accuracies of 94.7% for pure material and 97.71% for continuous fiber-reinforced composite 3D printing.
- Increased the tensile strength and elastic modulus by 17.29 and 44.80 times.

### Mobile Robotic Platform for Additive Manufacturing
*Apr. 2024 – Nov. 2025*
- Achieved an average positioning error of 1.41mm over a 200mm movement range.
- Secured invention patent in China (No. 7846171) for 3D printing robot design.

### Inverse Design of Mechanical Metamaterials Using Machine Learning
*Oct. 2024 – Present*
- Attained exceptional R² accuracies of 99.62% in computational modeling and 86.99% in experimental validation.
- Optimized inverse design results using prescribed weight vectors, balancing manufacturability and compactness.

## Education
-         Xi’an Jiaotong University (Undergraduate)                  June 2023 – Present
-         Xi’an Jiaotong University (Master’s)                       Sept. 2019 – June 2023

## Honors and Awards
