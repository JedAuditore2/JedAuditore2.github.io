### [<u>Machine Learning-Based Online Monitoring and Closed-Loop Controlling for 3D Printing of Continuous Fiber-Reinforced Composites</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950431725000061)
Published in *March 18*, 2025

This study addresses the challenge of ensuring consistent mechanical performance in 3D-printed continuous fiber-reinforced composites by developing a process monitoring and closed-loop feedback control strategy. Real-time image data from the printing process were analyzed using a neural network model with 94.70% accuracy to recognize flow rate values. A control module adjusted the flow rate in real time, improving surface quality and mechanical properties, including 3–6 times higher tensile strength and elastic modulus. The approach offers a generalized solution for remote, unmanned, or extreme environment 3D printing, enhancing reliability through intelligent monitoring and automatic adjustment.

### [<u>3D-printed Metamaterials with Versatile Functionalities</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772665723000302)
Published in *September 22*, 2023

Metamaterials are engineered structures with unique properties not found in natural materials, originally designed with periodic unit cells to control electromagnetic (EM) wave behavior. Recent advances have extended their applications across electromagnetic, thermal, acoustic, and mechanical domains. 3D printing has become a key technology in fabricating complex, multifunctional metamaterials with high precision and diverse material integration. This paper reviews the exceptional properties achieved by 3D-printed metamaterials in various fields and explores the interdependent relationship between their structure, functionality, and manufacturing processes, highlighting how additive manufacturing enables the development of advanced metamaterials with novel and integrated performance capabilities.

### [<u>Genetic algorithm-enabled mechanical metamaterials for vibration isolation with different payloads</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847824001837)
Published in *November 23*, 2024

This study tackles the challenge of mechanical vibration isolation under adaptable payloads by using machine learning to design quasi-zero stiffness metamaterials with customizable payloads. These metamaterials are fabricated via multi-material 3D printing. Dynamic tests confirm their effectiveness in isolating low-frequency vibrations across single and multiple payloads. The payload can be tailored to specific applications, enabling versatile energy shielding under varying scenarios and loading conditions, thus expanding the potential of adaptive mechanical systems.
